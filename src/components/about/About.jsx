          Firstly, let me introduce myself. My name is Julia and I am proud to say Polka Dots is my small but full of life salon in the lovely village of Deddington.
          My aim for the salon has always been about making you the guest feel at home and comfortable within a salon environment.
          Everyone is welcome in the salon, ladies and gents and children from the young to teenagers
          We want you to relax, laugh and have fun whilst being looked after and getting a great service at the same time.
          We offer a variety of services within the salon, from a six weekly trim, to a complete change of colour and style. Between us we have oodles of knowledge to suit your needs.
